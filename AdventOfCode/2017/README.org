Notes on range-v3


+ No template deduction guide
+ for_each vs transform (for_each requires returning another range to flatten, transform requires
  value)
+ No OP in accumulate, no initial value in partial_sum, no reduce/scan
+ Though compiler usually warns with dangling iterators, messages are quite unhelpful
+
