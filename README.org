* Obervations


  Perl:
  + Regex is good but other string utilities are missing. The fact that string are treated as
    scalars rather than arrays require a bit more even for indexing.
  + Related to above, since strings are scalars, it is not straightforward to write a generic
    function that operates both with strings and integers (eq vs ==)
  + Though map/filter/reduce exists in List::Util, others (e.g max/min) are missing a predicate
    block. To overcome this, I needed to either rewrite or perform multiple maps
