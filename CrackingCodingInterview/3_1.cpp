/*
 * Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks
 */

/*
 
This is a description problem and code is a bit messy. So, I will just write the
approach here. I might implement later

Approach 1: Fixed division
It is the first method that comes to mind.
Divide the array into three part and give each stack fixed sizes.
arr[0->n]
arr[n->2n]
arr[2n->3n]

Second approach is having a flexible array and growing as it is needed

However, quote from the book
"Please note that the code for this solution is far more complex than would be
appropriate for an interview. You could be responsible for pseudocode, or perhaps
the code of individual components, but the entire implementation would be far
too challenging"
